# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Model for Ghanaian Languages
## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for Ghanaian languages using the SpeechData dataset. The task involves pre-processing the dataset, designing and training a deep learning model for speech recognition in Akan, Ewe, Dagbani, Dagaaare, or Ikposo languages, and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics.

## Task Description

### Dataset Description
- The SpeechData dataset comprises audio recordings of spoken sentences in five Ghanaian languages and accents.
- The dataset consists of 1000 hours of audio for each language, accompanied by 100 hours of transcripts.
- The dataset is structured, with separate folders for audio files and their corresponding transcripts.

### Pre-processing
- Divided the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
- Applied audio pre-processing techniques including normalization, feature extraction (MFCC), and data augmentation.
- Converted text transcripts into numerical representations suitable for training the ASR model.

### Model Development
- Designed a deep learning architecture for speech recognition using TensorFlow.
- Experimented with various architectures including CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformer models.
- Implemented attention mechanisms to enhance model performance.

### Training
- Trained the ASR model using the training set.
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization techniques.
- Monitored training progress and visualized training/validation loss and accuracy.

### Evaluation
- Evaluated the trained model on the validation set using metrics like Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), and Accuracy.
- Fine-tuned the model based on validation performance.

### Testing
- Assessed the final trained model's generalization performance on the testing set.
- Calculated and reported final performance metrics on the testing set.

### Documentation and Reporting
- Prepared a comprehensive report documenting the entire process, including dataset pre-processing, model development, training, evaluation, and testing.
- Described the chosen model architecture, hyperparameters, training methodology, evaluation metrics, and results analysis.
- Presented visualizations such as loss curves and confusion matrices to aid in understanding the model's behavior.
- Discussed insights gained from the project, challenges encountered, and potential avenues for future improvements.
